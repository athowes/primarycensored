\usage{
rprimarycensoreddist(
  n,
  rdist,
  pwindow = 1,
  swindow = 1,
  D = Inf,
  rprimary = stats::runif,
  rprimary_args = list(),

  pwindow = 1,
  swindow = 1,
  D = Inf,
  rprimary = stats::runif,
  rprimary_args = list(),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of random samples to generate.}

\item{rdist}{Function to generate random samples from the delay distribution
for example \code{rlnorm} for lognormal distribution.}

\item{pwindow}{Primary event window}

\item{swindow}{Secondary event window (default: 1)}

\item{D}{Maximum delay (truncation point). If finite, the distribution is
truncated at D. If set to Inf, no truncation is applied. Defaults to Inf.}

\item{rprimary}{Function to generate random samples from the primary
distribution (default is \code{runif}).}

\item{rprimary_args}{List of additional arguments to be passed to rprimary.}

\item{oversampling_factor}{Factor by which to oversample the number of
samples to account for truncation (default is 1.2).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the distribution function.}
}
\value{
Vector of random samples from the primary event censored
distribution
}

\examples{
# Example: Lognormal distribution with uniform primary events
rprimarycensoreddist(10, rlnorm, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1)

# Example: Lognormal distribution with exponential growth primary events
rprimarycensoreddist(
  10, rlnorm,
  rprimary = rexpgrowth, rprimary_args = list(r = 0.2),
  meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1
