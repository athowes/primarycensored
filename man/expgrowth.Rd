\usage{
dexpgrowth(x, min = 0, max = 1, r, log = FALSE)

pexpgrowth(q, min = 0, max = 1, r, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)

rexpgrowth(n, min = 0, max = 1, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, q}{Vector of quantiles.}

\item{min}{Minimum value of the distribution range. Default is 0.}

\item{max}{Maximum value of the distribution range. Default is 1.}

\item{r}{Rate parameter for the exponential growth.}

\item{log, log.p}{Logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).}

\item{lower.tail}{Logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X â‰¤ x],
otherwise, P[X > x].}

\item{n}{Number of observations. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to
be the number required.}
}
\value{
\code{dexpgrowth} gives the density, \code{pexpgrowth} gives the distribution
function, and \code{rexpgrowth} generates random deviates.

The length of the result is determined by \code{n} for \code{rexpgrowth}, and is the
maximum of the lengths of the numerical arguments for the other functions.

\description{
Density, distribution function, and random generation for the exponential
growth distribution with parameters \code{min}, \code{max}, and \code{r}.

\details{
The exponential growth distribution is defined on the interval \link{min, max}
with rate parameter r. Its probability density function (PDF) is:

f(x) = r * exp(r * (x - min)) / (exp(r * max) - exp(r * min))

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is:

F(x) = (exp(r * (x - min)) - exp(r * min)) / (exp(r * max) - exp(r * min))

For random number generation, we use the inverse transform sampling method:
\enumerate{
\item Generate u ~ Uniform(0,1)
\item Set F(x) = u and solve for x:
x = min + (1/r) * log(u * (exp(r * max) - exp(r * min)) + exp(r * min))
}

This method works because of the probability integral transform theorem,
which states that if X is a continuous random variable with CDF F(x),
then Y = F(X) follows a Uniform(0,1) distribution. Conversely, if U is
a Uniform(0,1) random variable, then F^(-1)(U) has the same distribution
as X, where F^(-1) is the inverse of the CDF.

In our case, we generate u from Uniform(0,1), then solve F(x) = u for x
to get a sample from our exponential growth distribution. The formula
for x is derived by algebraically solving the equation:

u = (exp(r * (x - min)) - exp(r * min)) / (exp(r * max) - exp(r * min))

When r is very close to 0 (|r| < 1e-10), the distribution approximates
a uniform distribution on \link{min, max}, and we use a simpler method to
generate samples directly from this uniform distribution.
